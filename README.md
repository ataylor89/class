# A class on Python

This is a class on Python. We cover many subjects, including:

1. Factoring large numbers using sympy
    - It's actually difficult to factor large numbers by hand so it helps to know sympy
2. Calculating Pi using the Taylor series for arctan(x)
    - I can think of three ways to calculate Pi and this is one of them
3. The rot13 rotation cipher
    - It's a beautiful encryption algorithm but it's not secure
4. XOR encryption
    - It's a beautiful encryption algorithm and it's very secure

I hope you enjoy this class

Maybe I will add some more sections to the README later

Today is Saturday, July 26, 2025

I wish everyone a great weekend

## The plan

The plan for today is to explain each of the source files in this repository.

Also, we can add more source files to the repository.

I'm a little tired so I'm taking it easy today...

We can focus on this repository and add new files to the repository.
